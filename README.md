# RefViewer
RefViewer is an image viewer designed to aid artists and developers alike in their creative process. RefViewer allows you to quickly grab an image from anywhere you want, from a screenshot to dragging an image from your browser to selecting one from your local machine and then display that image while you work. 

### Technology
RefViewer is built with `Svelte` and `Electron`, and uses `Sharp` as it's main image processing engine.

### Get RefViewer
Download the most recent [stable build](https://github.com/starbrat/refviewer/releases/latest) or get a cutting-edge pre-release build from the [releases page](https://github.com/starbrat/refviewer/releases) (**Warning!** May contain bugs!).

I build RefViewer for Windows with each release, but if you are using a *nix machine, feel free to grab the source code and build it yourself. All you need to have installed is `Node`, `Electron` and `electron-builder`.

### Contributing
If you notice a bug, or want to suggest a new feature, feel free to create a Github issue, or contact me directly. You can follow the development process over on RefViewer's [Trello page](https://trello.com/b/NlCLf8lW/refviewer).
